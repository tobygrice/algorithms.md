Behavioural:
- Tell me about the hardest technical problem you've faced, and how you overcame it.
- Tell me about a time you faced conflict while working on a project, and how you handled it.

Easy: 
- 0217 - Contains Duplicate
- 0283 - Move Zeroes

Med: 
- 2745 - Construct the Longest New String
- 1630 - Arithmetic Subarrays

maybe a little bit too much detail on the introduction?
one project is enough

behavioural was really strong.
- finished making your point and ended strongly
- then added on another statement that was less strong
	- be confident that you've made your point, no need to keep talking

---

good with sample test cases but didn't ask explicit questions about input ranges

algorithm was almost perfect

got there very quickly

complexity analysis was not great

---

rushed into coding too quickly before you had a solution

missed the major subproblem of needing to determine if an AS can be formed
- assumed input array was sorted
