When you do a leetcode, spend hours studying a problem until you understand it 100%
- could take days
- perfectly understand every leetcode problem solution before you move on
- **learn and improve** from every mistake, don't just meet requirements
- build relationships and connections with industry

## Purpose Of The Roles
The primary method of tracking your progress throughout RSP will be through the use of roles. There are a lot of tasks for you to complete this summer, which can be both demotivating and exhausting, but the work can be made to feel easier when it’s broken into four distinct stages. The four roles of the Discord server represent these four stages, and they also function as your milestones.

The ultimate goal of this study program is to be awarded the final role of Advanced. All students who reach this step will have a great chance of passing internship interviews. In order to receive a role promotion, you must first complete the required tasks and then send a message to your mentor to organise a Zoom call. In the call, you will demonstrate evidence of your completed tasks, and we will quiz you on related topics.

Warning - do not ask for a role promotion if you have rushed the tasks and don’t properly understand all the required concepts. If we’re suspicious that you don’t truly understand the material, we will probe you more, find out, and won’t be happy. Ensure you thoroughly understand all the topics completely. 

## Beginner
This is the role where all students start in RSP. At this stage, you are reading Cracking The Coding Interview, reading The Algorithm Design Manual, and filling in the gaps with YouTube and Google.

This role does not require any tasks to get started.  

## Novice
This role is for students who have completely finished studying the theory. Congratulations! At this stage, you will start doing regular LeetCodes and weekly mock interviews. From this point onwards, we expect you to complete 10 coding problems a week and 2 mock interviews a week. For LeetCode problems and mock interviews to be counted in this program, they must be recorded in the website.
